The raspberry pi is in charge of the communication between the android tablet, the stm32, 
and the laptop that hosts the image recognition and path finding API.

We achieved this by using bluetooth sockets to connect to the tablet, pyserial to establish a serial link with the stm32, 
and python flask to house APIs that we can call from the raspberry pi.

We also used a multiprocessing library, to ensure that our raspberry pi can send and recieve messages from the different components concurrently.
